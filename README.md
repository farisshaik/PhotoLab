# PhotoLab
## Project Overview
This is a photo editing app created with Python and OpenCV. It can be used for quick image edits 
such as crops, transformations, rotation, drawing, adding filters, adjusting highlights, adding a
custom watermark and more. 

## Upcoming Features!
Working on light/ dark mode toggle, keyboard shortcuts, and improving performance by references instead of image copies whenever applying a change.

## Libraries
Libraries used include Open CV through PIL (Python imaging libary), Tkinter for the UI, and numpy
for image sizing and pixel specific edits.

## Usage
Add your image to the app with the **Import Image** button. The window will resize to add your
image, while keeping its aspect ratio intact.

Some of my sample images are inlcuded in this github. If you enjoy my photography, check out more
[here!](https://express.adobe.com/page/qo3IcRlzxwypj/) :)

Click the **Crop** button then drag across the part of the image you want to crop:

**Rotate/ Flip** by clicking the button which opens the respective menu on the right.

The **Draw Tool** defaults to a black brush. Use the **Select Color** button to choose 
a color, then drag to create a line.

The **Filters**, **Blur/ Smoothen**, and **Levels** buttons all open their respective menus on the
right side. Use these to add filters, adjust sharpness and highlights, etc.

Add a watermark with the **Add Logo** button. Import your logo then select the corner to add the 
logo to.

Apply your edits with the **Apply** button.
Undo them with the **Cancel** button.
Remove all edits with the **Revert** button.

When done, use the **Save** button!

** This is still a work in progress, thank you and enjoy! :) ***
